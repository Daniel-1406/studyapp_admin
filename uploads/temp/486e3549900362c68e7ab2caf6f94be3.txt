So R and k have same dimensions per mole? Actually [R] = [Energy][K⁻¹][mol⁻¹], [k] = [Energy][K⁻¹]. They differ by [mol⁻¹]. But dimensionally, per mole is just a number? Actually mol⁻¹ is not dimensionless; amount of substance is a base quantity. So they are not identical. However, in many MCQs, they treat them as same ignoring mol⁻¹. Let's check options: Specific heat capacity [L² T⁻² K⁻¹], not same. Planck's constant [M L² T⁻¹], not same. Avogadro constant [mol⁻¹], not same. So none exactly. But commonly, R and k are compared. Since R = k × N_A, their dimensions differ by [N_A] = [mol⁻¹]. But in terms of [M L T], both have [M L² T⁻² K⁻¹] for R and [M L² T⁻² K⁻¹] for k? Wait, k has [M L² T⁻² K⁻¹].

Alternatively, dimension of A can be from A = (μ₀/4π) ∫ (J/r) dV. [μ₀] = [M L T⁻² A⁻²], [J] = [A L⁻²], so [A] = [M L T⁻² A⁻²] × [A L⁻²] × [L] (for 1/r) × [L³] (for dV) = [M L T⁻² A⁻¹]? Let's compute carefully: A = (μ₀/4π) ∫ (J/r) dV. [J] = current density = I/area = [A L⁻²]. r is distance [L]. dV [L³]. So [J/r dV] = [A L⁻²]/[L] × [L³] = [A].

Yes, so answer A? But option C is [M L T⁻¹ A⁻¹]. There's discrepancy. Possibly I made mistake. Actually, 1 Wb = 1 V·s. V = J/C = kg·m²/(s²·A·s) = kg·m²/(s³·A). So V·s = kg·m²/(s²·A). So Wb/m = kg·m/(s²·A) = [M L T⁻² A⁻¹]. That matches option A. So correct answer is A. But option A is [M L T⁻² A⁻¹]. So we select A.,A,,Determine using known units.,,Magnetic vector potential A is measured in weber per meter (Wb/m). Wb = V·s = (J/C)·s = (kg·m²/s²)/(A·s)·s = kg·m²/(s²·A).
